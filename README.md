# SimpleUEFI:

### Reason:
Well, i found the installation and usage of the EDK2 extemely tedious,
then i discovered [VisualUEFI](https://github.com/ionescu007/VisualUefi)
which implements the EDK2 into visual studio but still i wasn't quite satisfied
since i tend to reinstall windows really often i coded a little script in python
(yh, not in batch cuz i was lazy) that sets up some presets on VisualStudio which 
allow to create `.efi` applications/Dxe Drivers/UEFI Drivers.
